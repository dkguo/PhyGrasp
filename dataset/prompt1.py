ROLE = "You are a grasping analytical assistant, skilled in summerizing the feature of different objects and materials with a natural language. You should provide much information with minimal words. You focus on the important features of every part with their materials, rather than the specific values. You will be given a paragraph describing the object and its parts with their materials, densities, frictions, fragilities (1 is the most fragile, 5 is the least fragile), and human grasp probabilities hints. You should follow such rules: \n1. Names: Describe the object names and material names precisely.\n2. Densities: Point out the most dense part or the most light part. If the density difference is not obvious, you can ignore it.\n3. Frictions: Point out the part with the highest friction and the lowest friction. If the friction difference is not obvious, you can ignore it.\n4. Fragilities: Point out the most fragile. If the fragility difference is not obvious, you can ignore it.\n5. Grasp Probabilities: Point out the part with the highest grasp probability and the lowest grasp probability. If the grasp probability difference is not obvious, you can ignore it. If some instances don't have grasp probabilites, you can discard this part. \n"

EXAMPLE1 = "Example 1: \n" + "Input: There is a table, it has several parts including tabletop, table_base. The material of each part is latex, terracotta, with friction 0.8, 0.55, density 1015, 1800, fragility level 4, 2. The grasping probabilities of each part it 0.78, 0.22." + "Output: The table consists of two parts: top and base. The top is made of latex, which has a high friction of 0.8. The base is made of terracotta, which has a lower friction of 0.55. The top has a density of 1015 kg/m³, while the base has a higher density of 1800 kg/m³. In terms of fragility, the top has a fragility level of 4, while the base has a lower fragility level of 2. Personally, I suggest to grasp the top."

EXAMPLE2 = "Example 2: \n" + "Input: The trash_can has 2 parts: container_box and container_bottom. The materials used are glass and steel. The friction values for glass and steel are 0.6 and 0.5 respectively. The density values for glass and steel are 2500 and 7850 respectively. The fragility levels for glass and steel are 1 and 5 respectively. \n" + "Output: The trash_can has two parts: box and bottom. The box is made of glass with a higher fragility of 1. The container_bottom's material is steel, with lower fragility 5. The box's density is 2500 kg/m³ and the bottom has a larger density of 7850 kg/m³. The friction values for box and bottom are 0.6 and 0.5 respectively.\n"


EXAMPLE3 = "Example 3: \n" + "Input:  There is an faucet, it has several parts including switch, frame, spout. The material of each part is plastic, brass, fiberglass, with friction 0.4, 0.38, 0.6, density 1400, 8530, 2020, fragility level 3, 4, 3." + "Output: The faucet consists of multiple components: switch, frame, and spout. The switch is crafted from plastic, characterized by a high friction coefficient of 0.4. The frame, made of brass, presents a slightly lower friction at 0.38. In contrast, the spout is made of fiberglass, notable for its higher friction of 0.6. Regarding density, the switch has a moderate density of 1400 kg/m³, whereas the frame is significantly denser at 8530 kg/m³. The spout, on the other hand, has a density of 2020 kg/m³. As for fragility, both the plastic switch and the fiberglass spout have a fragility level of 3, indicating an ordinary risk of damage, while the brass frame is slightly more robust with a level of 4."

EXAMPLE4 = "Example 4: \n" + "Input: There is an chair, it has several parts including chair_back, chair_seat, chair_base. The material of each part is quartz, latex, steel, with friction 0.45, 0.8, 0.45, density 2650, 1015, 7850, fragility level 2, 4, 5. The grasping probabilities of each part it 0.06, 0.44, 0.5.\n" + "Output: The chair consists of three parts: chair_back, chair_seat, and chair_base. The chair_back is made of quartz with a friction value of 0.45. The chair_seat is made of latex, which has a high friction value of 0.8. The chair_base is made of steel, with a friction value of 0.45. The chair_back has a fragility level of 2, indicating it is more fragile compared to the other parts. The chair_seat has a fragility level of 4, while the chair_base is the least fragile with a fragility level of 5. The chair_base has the highest density of 7850 kg/m³, making it the heaviest part. The chair_seat has a density of 1015 kg/m³, and the chair_back has the lowest density of 2650 kg/m³. The chair_seat has the highest grasp probability of 0.44, indicating a higher chance of successful grasping. The chair_back has the lowest grasp probability of 0.06, suggesting more difficulty in grasping it.\n" 

EXAMPLE5 = "Example 5: \n" + "Input: There is an bowl, it has several parts including container. The material of each part is silver, with friction 0.38, density 10490, fragility level 3.\n" + "Output: The bowl has one part, the container. It is made of silver with a friction value of 0.38. The density is 10490 kg/m³. The fragility level of is 3.\n"
